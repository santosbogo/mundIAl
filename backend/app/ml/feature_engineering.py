"""
Computes an 11-dimensional feature vector for each (UserProfile, Match) pair.

Features:
  0  team_affinity          — favorite team is playing (0/1)
  1  rival_affinity         — rival of favorite team is playing (0–1)
  2  star_player_playing    — user's favorite player is in this squad (0/1)
  3  availability_score     — fraction of match time NOT covered by busy calendar events (0–1)
  4  timezone_penalty       — local hour inconvenience (0–1, late night = 1)
  5  rivalry_index          — H2H rivalry intensity from match data (0–10) → normalized /10
  6  star_power             — combined star power of both teams, normalized (0–1)
  7  group_stakes           — importance by round_in_group (0–1)
  8  expected_competitiveness — closeness of FIFA rankings (0–1, equal = 1)
  9  narrative_score        — pre-computed match narrative value (0–10) → normalized /10
  10 regional_affinity      — user country shares confederation with a team (0/1)
